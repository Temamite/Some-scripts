# Some-scripts
A few scripts from Torn Apart, a game jam game made in 2021.
Commented in Finnish

In addition, a couple of RANDOM MindSeize scripts. Not commented as I was not doing that for whatever stupid reason (Well, other than the GorillaAI which has at least a bit as it was kind of a template for our other programmer to use as well), making reading them incredibly difficult afterwards. Most are special functionality of bosses/enemies (outside of regular abilities they have in different scripts).
